# 🏥 Hospital Management System  

A **C++ project** that manages patients, doctors, and appointments using **AVL Trees**, **Linked Lists**,  **File Handling**, and other **Data Structure**.  
It simulates a real hospital workflow with efficient storage, quick searching, and appointment scheduling.  

---

##  Features  
- Add, update, delete, and search patients  
- Book and cancel appointments  
- Store patient data in a **self-balancing AVL Tree** for efficient lookup  
- Persistent data storage using **file handling**  
- Display reports and summaries  

---

##  Data Structures Used  
- **Linked List** → for managing appointments  
- **AVL Tree** → for fast patient record searching  
- **Queue** (optional if implemented) → for handling appointment scheduling  
- **File Handling** → for persistent storage of patients & appointments  

---

## Algorithms Used  
- **AVL Balancing Algorithm** → ensures O(log n) search and insert operations  
- **CRUD Operations** → for patient management  
- **Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)** → to display patient data  
- **Search Algorithm** → quick patient lookup by ID
